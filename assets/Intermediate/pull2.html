<code>$   git push github neel</code> 

<p>Now when people clone or fetch from that repository, they'll get an 'neel' branch they can look at and merge from. You can push any branch to any remote repository that you have write access to in this way. If your branch is already on the server, it will try to update it, if it is not, Git will add it.</p>
